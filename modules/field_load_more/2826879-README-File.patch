+Field Load More for Developers
+=======================
+
+Project site: http://drupal.org/project/field_load_more
+
+Code: https://drupal.org/project/field_load_more/git-instructions
+
+Issues: https://drupal.org/project/issues/field_load_more
+
+What Is This?
+-------------
+
+This module provides a feature for fields with unlimited cardinality, through
+which administrator can initially show a specified number of items, and load more
+button to display rest of the elements based on the count mentioned by him.
+
+
+How To Use Field Load More
+-----------------------
+
+1. Download and Enable the module.
+
+2. If you dont have multivalued field, then create a multivalued field or change
+cardinality of the field to unlimited, in which you want to use this feature,
+under Manage Fields.
+
+3. Go to Manage Display tab of the content type, and click settings (gear) icon
+of the field.
+
+4. You will see a checkbox for "Enable Load more widget for the field", enable it.
+
+5. Enter the initial number of items, which will be displayed under
+"Number of items to display by default". Please note that on clicking "Load More"
+button, no of items which will load, will depend on the number which you have
+entered. If you have entered 5 in above textfield for image field, then initially
+5 image will be shown, and on clicking on "Load More", 5 more will be shown.
+
+6. Click on update, save the display.
+
+
+How To Install The Modules
+--------------------------
+
+1. The Field Load More project installs like any other Drupal module. There is extensive
+documentation on how to do this here:
+https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8 But essentially:
+Download the tarball and expand it into the modules/ directory in your Drupal 8
+installation.
+
+2. Within Drupal, enable any Field Load More module in Admin
+menu > Extend.
+
+3. Settings of Field Load More will show in Manage Display tab for individual content
+type, which have multivalued field, with unlimited cadinality.
